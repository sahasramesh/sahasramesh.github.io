            Hi, Mirrs. My special girl. My shining star. I could go
            on and on. Since the day I met you, my whole world has changed. I'll never forget that first kiss on
            the cheek you gave me, because it marked the start of 
            our magical journey together. You're unlike any person 
            I've ever metâ€“beautiful, kind, funny, and infinitely 
            curious. I'm so excited to spend this piece of my life 
            with you, and with any luck, this will be the first of 
            many times I get to wish you a very 
            happy birthday! I love you to the moon and back, 
            and I'm counting the days until I get to hold you in my 
            arms again.<br><br>
        
            <span class="right-align">Yours forever,<br>
            Sahas</span>
