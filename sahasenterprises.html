    <b>Sahas Ramesh</b> - <i>Founder & CEO</i><br>
    Behind every enterprise is a Founder & CEO.
    Sahas Ramesh is one such man. Sahas has been
    a driving force in the technology industry
    since its inception, and his contributions
    to the space have propelled it forward to
    the state that it is in today. He doesn’t
    own a dog, but he’s the kind of guy who
    would have a dog, you know, like, he’s just
    a really great guy.

    <b>Dhruv Shekar</b> - <i>Head of Marketing & Senior Solutions Architect</i><br>
    Dhruv Shekar doesn’t know much about
    architecture, but you can bet your last
    dollar he knows a heck of a lot about
    solutions. Dhruv Shekar is an all-rounder in
    every sense of the word: he has an abundance
    of modeling experience, and he spearheads the
    marketing department at Sahas Enterprises. I
    would trust him with my life.

    <b>Anish Chakrabarty</b> - <i>Chief Managerial Officer & Chief Operational Officer</i><br>
    If you need a Chief Managerial Officer & Head
    of Finance, you can’t get much better than
    Anish Chakrabarty. Anish has a vast amount of
    experience in things like managing and operating
    and was one of the first businessmen to
    popularize shorting the rock industry. At some
    point, people will stop buying rocks; it’s not a
    matter of if, but when.

    <b>Rohan Duvur</b> - <i>Head of Engineering</i><br>
    Head of Engineering Rohan Duvur isn't so much
    a human as he is an enterprising machine. Duvur
    has the spirit of a lone wolf with a heart of
    cold and I can only imagine how productive he
    would be if he didn't go to the bathroom for
    three hours everyday and audibly cry in the stall.

    <b>Asher Khattak</b> - <i>Janitor</i><br>
    Janitor Asher Khattak is the nicest guy I've ever met. One time
    when I was on my lunch break, I accidentally dropped
    my crunchwrap supreme on the floor and he said "Don't worry
    about it, I'll clean this up" and I was like "Thanks" and
    then he said "Yeah no problem, this is my job."

    <b>Parth Parikh</b> - <i>Senior Vice Intermediary Associate</i><br>
    Well golly. Well good gosh. In our circles, Parth is known.
    Parth is probably exacting.  I've noticed that his lofty ideals
    sit grounded into the earth, like loamy cloud dirt. I mean, it
    should be evident from his actions that Parth is, actually,
    somebody who acts. In fact: if you were to carefully look at him,
    chances are that you'd look away eventually. At his very core,
    Parth could be described. And I think that's admirable. I've
    always had my disagreements with Parth, and agreements. When he
    was initially hired, he was given a job here. I said to him, "

    <b>Sumeet Sra</b> - <i>Social Media Manager</i><br>
    The first thing you notice about Sumeet is his tophat. You know,
    we've never seen him without it- but he's told us that his skull
    shaped around the darn thing because he wore it so much. And
    that's entirely plausible: He's too consistent to be a wild card
    and with that huge tophat covering his face in shadows, he's
    certainly not the looks of this operation. That tophat, while it
    may be the only thing we know about him, is a testament to his
    refined nature, to his poise. Upon any other head it would be a
    simple fabric, but with him it is the crown of a king! Oh, the
    heavens must sing with praises of his virtue. I dread the day he
    needs to laundry that thing -  the accumulated grease would do
    more damage than a regularly scheduled Shell oil spill. But of
    course, that's never gonna happen. This tall man is dwarfed by
    the tophat that represents him.
